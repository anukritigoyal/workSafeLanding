                    Our solution is an enterprise wide reporting system that allows employees to privately report any identity 
                    based harassment or generalized aggressive behavior. Both HR personnel and reporters can track how their report 
                    is being processed via this tool, adding a layer of accountability that was not present prior to this tool.
