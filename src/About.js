                            Harassment in the workplace has increased over the past decade despite continued efforts to implement inclusive policies 
                            and practices. One aspect of this is companyâ€™s failure to implement efficient reporting mechanisms that instill confidence 
                            that they will diligently evaluate and exact justice for any given report.
